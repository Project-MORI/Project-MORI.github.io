      <description>Ibama already has had more than 100 drones to monitor illegal deforetation. These are all multicopter drone, which are suitable for observing a wide aerial view and acquiring detailed ground data of a small area, but cannot fly for long periods due to their battery life. The National Center for Environmental Monitoring and Information - Cenima, which coordinates this project, is responsible for sending deforestation detection data by satellite to the inspection department. In order to improve the accuracy of these data, it will be necessary to verify it using detailed ground data from a large area.</description>

      <description>A field survey was conducted from May 25 to June 1, based in Rio Branco, Acre. The actual survey was conducted in three states, which included the Rondonia and Amazonas. The purpose of this survey was to conduct a field evaluation of the new JJ-FAST algorithm used in the project, which was substantially updated in April. A helicopter was flown by IBAMA to conduct the survey from the air, and a vehicle was used to conduct the survey from the ground.</description>
