      <description>A field survey of deforestation was conducted in late October 2021. This was to confirm the results of deforestation detection by JJ-FAST developed by JICA and JAXA, and was conducted in Rondonia. The results showed that all the detections were correct, and sadly, deforestation had occurred. However, fire was also present, so a comparison of when the fire occurred and when JJ-FAST detected deforestation will be conducted in the future, using a variety of satellite data.</description>
