The 1st JCC was held on September 15 in the presence of IBAMA President, <!--more-->
Minister of Embassy of Japan, Deputy Director General of JICA Office, Ministry of Environment, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and relevant IBAMA departments.
At the meeting, IBAMA and project experts reported on the progress of the project during the past year, and it was confirmed that the project was generally being implemented as planned, although there were some delays in project activities due to delays in the dispatch of experts and procurement of equipment in connection with COVID-19.
It was also confirmed that there is a need to further strengthen collaboration with IBAMA's regulatory department, which is the user of the data generated by the project, and to strengthen cooperation with the government to reflect scientific data in policy.
Finally, the participants discussed the activity plan for the coming year, and agreed on some changes in the timing of activities and the promotion of activities that are lagging behind.
It had been 10 years since IBAMA had held a JCC since the previous Project, but the Brazilian and Japanese sides, led by the project manager, worked together and successfully implemented the JCC. The JCC was successfully implemented.
We will continue to promote the project activities under this cooperative framework.
