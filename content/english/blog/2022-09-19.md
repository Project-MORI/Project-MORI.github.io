On September 15, the first JCC was held, which is an annual meeting for all parties concerned in Brazil and Japan to review the progress of the project and to confirm and discuss the activity plan for the coming year.<!--more-->
The project director, the President of IBAMA, the JICA office, as well as the Embassy of Japan, the Ministry of Environment of Brazil, and Brazilian Cooperation Agency were present to report on the progress of the project over the past year. Although there are some delays in the project activities, it was appreciated that the Japan-Brazil project members are cooperating with each other. It was confirmed that the project will continue to move forward to reduce illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by strengthening cooperation not only with CENIMA, the main implementing department of the project, but also with DIPRO, the regulatory department that is the user of the information generated, and with the Ministry of Environment to ensure that the project results are also linked to policy. The project will continue to be carried out in order to reduce illegal logging in the Brazilian Amazon.
