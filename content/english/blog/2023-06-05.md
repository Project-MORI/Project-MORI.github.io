A field survey was conducted from May 25 to June 1, based in Rio Branco, Acre. <!--more--> The actual survey was conducted in three states, which included the Rondonia and Amazonas.
The purpose of this survey was to conduct a field evaluation of the new JJ-FAST algorithm used in the project, which was substantially updated in April.
A helicopter was flown by IBAMA to conduct the survey from the air, and a vehicle was used to conduct the survey from the ground.
The new algorithm has increased the possibility of detecting deforestation at an earlier stage, making it more useful for early enforcement. On the other hand, it was also found that some wetlands were incorrectly detected and that some logging patterns could not be detected, suggesting the need for further improvement.
