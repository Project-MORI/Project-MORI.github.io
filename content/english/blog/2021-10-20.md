A field survey of deforestation was conducted in late October 2021.
This was to confirm the results of deforestation detection by JJ-FAST <!--more-->developed by JICA and JAXA, and was conducted in Rondonia.
The results showed that all the detections were correct, and sadly, deforestation had occurred.  However, fire was also present, so a comparison of when the fire occurred and when JJ-FAST detected deforestation will be conducted in the future, using a variety of satellite data.
