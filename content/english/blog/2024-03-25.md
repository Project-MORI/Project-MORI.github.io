We conducted our third field survey in Altamira, State of Para, <!--more--> after having carried out the previous survey in October 2023. This time, our objective was on validating the forest changes detected by ALOS-2 data observed on March 12, 2024, to assess the effectiveness of JJ-FAST during the rainy season. Compared to the dry season and previous rainy seasons, the areas of forest change we found were fewer and smaller. Although we had pre-selected 17 sites for this survey including areas of small-scale deforestation, due to road conditions and other factors, only 6 sites were actually visited, along with one additional site for follow-up on previous survey. It has been reported that deforestation decreased significantly last year, and we had the impression that deforestation in this rainy season was also decreasing compared to 2022, the last time the survey was conducted in the rainy season in Altamira. While we were able to reliably detect deforestation areas and new forest degradation sites, we also identified false detected points in wetland-like sites caused by heavy rainfall, which represents a challenge for the current detection algorithm. The survey results will be organized and shared with each team to improve the accuracy of the system.
