From April 24 to 28, short-term experts from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)<!--more-->
came to Brazil to conduct training workshop in machine learning (AI).
While last year's workshop was about a brief overview of AI, this time learnt more deep knowledge about the mathematical details of machine learning, especially deep learning, before the training in Japan, which is scheduled to take place in August and September of this year.
Although the five participants struggled with difficult mathematical elements, they were able to deepen their understanding through explanations from experts and discussions among themselves.
This training should help the participants to understand how deep learning programs are processed.
In addition, it was also a great learning opportunity for the participants to create their own programs in the future, as well as understand the programs built in the project.
