The project uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as machine learning and deep learning methods, <!--more-->to create a deforestation prediction system. The system is currently being developed by the team at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), but in order for the Brazilian side to be able to operate continuously in the future, to be able to improve as needed, and also for AI to be used in the future in areas other than prediction, a training course was held in Japan from August 28 to September 8 with the aim of learning the technologies used in AI.
Five Projectâ€™s members from Ibama involved in AI visited Japan to acquire further knowledge based on what they had learned in the AI training conducted in Brazil.
At the end of the training, with the knowledge learned, they built the basis of a cattle counting system in the Amazon using drone and satellite images in order to observe the situation of cattle grazing, which is one of the deforestation deivers.
The counterparts expressed their enthusiasm to continue acquiring knowledge even after returning to Brazil.
In addition, three of the five members were also team of a project that was implemented 14 years ago, and they had the opportunity to meet with the experts of that time for the first time in about 10 years, and had a lively conversation about the old days.
