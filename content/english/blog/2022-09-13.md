From September 12 to 16, experts from JAXA and AIST visited Brazil to conduct a training course on AI and SAR.<!--more-->
In the SAR analysis training conducted by JAXA, the participants examined the patterns of deforestation in the Amazon and how SAR data changes during deforestation, in order to improve the accuracy of early detection of forest change. In the AI programming training conducted by AIST, participants learned about machine learning methods using Python. Although the detection mechanism and mathematical formulas were difficult for the participants, they were able to understand them better by incorporating concrete examples. For the Brazilian side, this training was useful to learn about technology, while for the Japanese side, it was a good opportunity to understand the situation of illegal deforestation in Brazil. We will continue to share information online on a regular basis and collaborate with each other to promote project activities.
