In February 2022, the second field survey in Altamira in the state of Par√° was conducted as part of the project.
Based on the previous review of forest degradation data detected by the JJ-FAST and DETER systems, <!--more-->a list of 24 possible sites was prepared, of which 17 were visited.
We could not visit all the sites listed because the road conditions were worse than expected and it took a long time to reach them.
All of them showed that the forests have actually been deforested. The patterns will be analyzed in the future as the patterns varied greatly. Those that were cleared several months earlier, but the satellite was delayed in detecting, and others that the satellite was able to observe the initial process of deforestation.
