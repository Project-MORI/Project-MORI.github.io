A workshop on deep learning and remote sensing in Python was held from August 22 to 26, 2022. Project-MORI plans to use Python and/or other programming languages that can be used for deep learning for deforestation detection and prediction. <!--more-->The Brazilian members are all professionals in remote sensing using GIS software that handles geospatial information, but few of them have experience using Python, so they struggled to learn Python.
Using Google Colaboratory, a Python runtime environment provided by Google, we learned the basics of Python, including the acquisition and display of geospatial information, as well as object detection and recognition using deep learning.
Since there was a lot of content in a short period of one week, it was difficult to learn everything at once, and we hope to repeat the learning process and acquire the skills little by little.
